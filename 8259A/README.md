# 8259A-PROGRAMMABLE-INTERRUPT-CONTROLLER

## Introduction
Welcome to the 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controller project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive implementation of the 8259A PIC, a vital component in computer systems for managing interrupts. 

## Features
- **Interrupt Handling**: The 8259A PIC allows efficient handling of interrupts, ensuring smooth execution of your software.
- **Programmable Configuration**: Customize the PIC's behavior by programming its various registers to suit your specific requirements.
- **Cascade Mode**: Take advantage of the PIC's cascade mode to expand the number of interrupt lines available.
- **Interrupt Prioritization**: Prioritize interrupts based on their importance to ensure critical tasks are handled first.
- **Masking and Unmasking**: Easily enable or disable interrupts by masking or unmasking specific interrupt lines.
- **Interrupt Request (IRQ) Management**: Manage IRQs effectively, allowing devices to request attention from the CPU when needed.
- **Compatibility**: The 8259A PIC is widely supported and compatible with various computer architectures.

## Modules
This project consists of the following modules:

### 8259A Driver
The 8259A Driver module provides an interface to interact with the 8259A PIC. It includes functions for configuring registers, handling interrupts, and managing IRQs. This module serves as the backbone of the project, allowing seamless communication with the PIC.

### Interrupt Handler
The Interrupt Handler module implements the logic for handling interrupts and dispatching them to the appropriate interrupt service routines (ISRs). It ensures that interrupts are processed efficiently and that the appropriate actions are taken based on the interrupt source.

### IRQ Manager
The IRQ Manager module is responsible for managing the allocation and deallocation of IRQs. It ensures that each device is assigned a unique interrupt line and handles conflicts that may arise when multiple devices request the same IRQ.

### Example Code
The Example Code module includes sample code that demonstrates how to use the 8259A PIC in your own projects. It provides practical examples and serves as a starting point for integrating the PIC into your software.
